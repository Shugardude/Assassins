Assassins
=========

A game to help you learn people's names... by KILLING them!


GAME DESCRIPTION

Every player must create an account that consists of a username, password and profile.  It is important that the first name and last name entered in the profile are truthful in order for the game to work.  Each player will also create a secret password in their profile.  This password must be remembered in order for a player to confirm an assassination.

After signing in, one player must create a group that every other player will join.  This player will be the admin of the group and will be able to see the players that are currently logged in to the group.  When all players have joined, the admin can start the game.  The players will decide beforehand how they plan to signal to each other that they have assassinated their target.  A player will then press the 'Kill Target' button and enter the target's secret password.  That player will then be assigned their next target automatically.  Only one player can win in the end!
